# GitHub Rules

## Repository Management
- Use `main` branch as primary development branch
- Enable branch protection rules for main branch
- Require pull request reviews before merging to main
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`
- Keep repository public for GitHub Pages deployment

## GitHub Pages Deployment
- Use GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Deploy from `dist/` directory after Vite build process
- Enable GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source
- Set custom domain: `www.parkandpaint.co.uk` via CNAME file
- Configure DNS: CNAME record pointing to `username.github.io`

## Workflow Configuration
- Use Node.js 20 for consistent build environment
- Cache npm dependencies for faster builds
- Run on `push` to main branch and manual `workflow_dispatch`
- Set proper permissions: `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`
- Allow only one concurrent deployment to prevent conflicts

## Issue & PR Management
- Use issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Label issues appropriately: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- Link PRs to related issues using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`
- Require PR descriptions explaining changes and testing
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress features

## Security & Access
- Enable dependency security alerts
- Use GitHub's secret scanning for sensitive data
- Limit repository access to necessary collaborators
- Enable two-factor authentication for all contributors
- Regular security updates for dependencies

## Dependabot Configuration
- Use `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates
- Schedule weekly updates on Mondays at 9:00 AM London time
- Group minor and patch updates together to reduce PR noise
- Assign security-related PRs to repository maintainer
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `deps:` for npm, `ci:` for GitHub Actions
- Limit open PRs: 10 for npm dependencies, 5 for GitHub Actions
- Apply appropriate labels: `dependencies`, `security`, `github-actions`

## Documentation Standards
- Maintain comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Keep QUICKSTART.md updated with current deployment steps
- Document all environment variables and configuration
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

## Branch Strategy
- Feature branches: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/contact-form`)
- Bug fixes: `fix/description` (e.g., `fix/mobile-menu`)
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/critical-issue`
- Delete merged branches to keep repository clean
- Use descriptive branch names that explain the purpose

## Release Management
- Tag releases with semantic versioning: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`
- Create release notes describing changes and improvements
- Test deployment on staging before production release
- Monitor deployment status and rollback if necessary
