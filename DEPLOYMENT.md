## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment

Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automatic deployment:

1. **Developer pushes code** to `main` branch
2. **GitHub Actions** detects the push
3. **Workflow runs** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - Checks out code
   - Sets up Node.js 20
   - Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Builds project (`npm run build`)
   - Deploys `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
4. **Site goes live** within ~2 minutes
5. **CDN propagates** within ~10 minutes

### Manual Deployment Trigger

If needed, you can manually trigger a deployment:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Bobbyberta/park-and-paint/actions
2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select `main` branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Monitoring Deployment Status

**Check deployment status:**
- URL: https://github.com/Bobbyberta/park-and-paint/actions
- Look for green ‚úì (success) or red ‚úó (failed)
- Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs

**Typical deployment timeline:**
- Build time: ~1-2 minutes
- Deployment time: ~30 seconds
- CDN propagation: ~5-10 minutes
- Total time to live: ~10-15 minutes

## üìã Configuration Files

### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)

```javascript
base: '/',  // Must be '/' for custom domain (NOT '/park-and-paint/')
```

**Important:** The `base` path must be `/` for custom domains. Using a project path like `/park-and-paint/` will cause all assets to fail loading.

### CNAME File (`public/CNAME`)

```
www.parkandpaint.co.uk
```

This file tells GitHub Pages to serve the site on your custom domain.

### GitHub Pages Settings

**Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages:**
- Source: GitHub Actions
- Custom domain: www.parkandpaint.co.uk
- Enforce HTTPS: ‚úì Enabled
- Branch: main (via GitHub Actions)

- [ ] Update expiration date in documentation

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Assets Not Loading (404 Errors)

**Symptom:** Images, CSS, or JS files return 404 errors

**Solution:**
1. Check `vite.config.js` has `base: '/'`
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Commit and push changes
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Domain Not Working

**Symptom:** Site shows "404 - There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"

**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub Pages settings has custom domain: www.parkandpaint.co.uk
2. Verify `public/CNAME` file exists with correct domain
3. Check DNS settings in Wix point to `bobbyberta.github.io`
4. Wait up to 48 hours for DNS propagation

### Deployment Failing

**Symptom:** GitHub Actions workflow shows red ‚úó

**Solution:**
1. Check workflow logs: https://github.com/Bobbyberta/park-and-paint/actions
2. Common issues:
   - Build errors: Fix code issues and push again
   - Node version mismatch: Workflow uses Node 20
   - Dependencies issues: Update `package-lock.json`
3. Try manual workflow trigger after fixing

### Google Analytics Not Tracking

**Symptom:** No data appearing in GA4 dashboard

**Solution:**
1. Verify tracking code in `index.html` has correct ID: G-E718YMXYXN
2. Check browser console for gtag.js errors
3. Disable ad blockers when testing
4. Wait 24-48 hours for data to appear
5. Use GA4 DebugView for real-time testing
